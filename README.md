# Azure-App-Service-Availability

**App Services** is a **Platform as a Service** offering, where OS upgrades, scaling, and load balancing are handled by the platform itself.
 
An App Service scale unit has several pools of Workers pre-provisioned and ready to host your application. The compute resources of these Workers are defined by the App Service Plan, which in-turn is a collection of VM's which have same compute resources. App Services are hosted on VMs and these are managed by the platform.
